# nexora - University Learning Project

Corporate website for nexora web studio, built with Nuxt 3 with a focus on modern design, animations, and SEO optimization.

## Technologies

- **Nuxt 3** - Vue.js framework
- **GSAP** - animations and interactivity
- **Tailwind CSS** - styling
- **TypeScript** - type safety
- **SCSS** - style preprocessor

## Features

- Full-screen sections with smooth transitions
- Interactive diagram with customizable effects
- Responsive design
- SEO optimization (meta tags, structured data, semantic markup)
- Service pages with detailed information

## Important

⚠️ **This is a university learning project.** Due to time constraints, most of the code was written in fast development mode (fast coding / vibe coding) and requires refactoring for production use. The design was also created in a short timeframe and is not well thought out, just like the code.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
